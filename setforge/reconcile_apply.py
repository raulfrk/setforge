"""Apply the 3-way reconcile engine to a single plain tracked file.

The install-side glue that activates the (otherwise dormant) reconcile
engine for **plain** tracked files — those with no ``disposition`` and no
``spans`` (files that the legacy path would deploy verbatim). Files that
carry a disposition or spans stay on the legacy ``deploy`` path until
they are migrated onto the engine (a separate follow-up).

:func:`reconcile_plain_file` is pure with respect to the filesystem: it
reads the recorded base from the store, runs :func:`setforge.reconcile.merge`
against the live + tracked content, drives the conflict wizard when needed,
and returns a :class:`ReconcileOutcome` describing what the caller should
do — it never writes the live file and never advances the store itself.
That split keeps the decision logic unit-testable and lets the caller
slot the write + ``record`` into the install pipeline's write pass.

Outcomes encode the A0 guards directly:

- ``NOOP`` — the merge is clean AND already matches live with the base
  already at tracked: an idempotent re-install writes nothing and does not
  re-record (no store churn).
- ``WRITE`` — deploy ``content`` to live and ``record`` ``new_base``.
- ``DEFERRED`` — a region was skipped in the wizard; write nothing and do
  NOT re-baseline (the unresolved upstream change must re-surface next run).
- ``CANCELLED`` — the user aborted the whole-file wizard; write nothing,
  record nothing.
