# Changelog

All notable changes to setforge are tracked here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-31

The rename release. setforge is the renamed, re-architected successor
to the prior `my-setup` tool. v0.2.0 is the first release under the new
name. Major restructuring across the engine, with no breaking changes
to the YAML config surface beyond the file rename.

### Changed
- **Renamed the engine** from `my-setup` to `setforge`. The Python
  package is now `setforge`, the CLI entry point is `setforge`, env
  vars use the `SETFORGE_` prefix, and the XDG state directory moved
  from `~/.local/state/my-setup/` to `~/.local/state/setforge/`. See
  the README's "Upgrading from my-setup v0.x" section for the
  migration recipe.
- **Renamed the config file** from `my_setup.yaml` to `setforge.yaml`.
  Engine surfaces a migration error pointing at the new filename when
  the old name is detected.
- **Renamed identifiers**: `Dotfile` class → `TrackedFile`, the
  `dotfiles:` YAML key → `tracked_files:`, `Profile.dotfiles` →
  `Profile.tracked_files`. The "dotfile" term is no longer used in
  any user-facing surface.
- **Split the engine from user config**. The engine repo no longer
  carries `setforge.yaml` or `tracked/`; both live in a separate
  user-owned config repo discovered via the source layer (CLI
  `--source` > `SETFORGE_SOURCE` env > `~/.config/setforge/local.yaml`
  > CWD fallback).
- **Split `cli.py` into a `setforge.cli` subpackage** (2,119 lines
  → 11 per-area files). Public API unchanged; `setforge --help`
  output is bit-for-bit identical to the pre-split snapshot.

### Added
- **`setforge fetch` subcommand** — clones / fetches the configured
  git source and checks out its pinned ref. Path-based sources are a
  no-op.
- **Source-layer discovery** — 4-tier `--source` > env >
  `~/.config/setforge/local.yaml` > CWD fallback. Schema enforces a
  single source per user; tagged-union `kind:` discriminator selects
  between `PathSource` and `GitSource`.
- **Git management subsystem** — `setforge fetch` orchestrates clone /
  fetch / dirty-gate / ref-checkout via `setforge.git_ops`. Dirty
  checkouts of `tracked/` abort with an actionable error; post-sync
  emits a hint pointing the user at the source dir for `git diff +
  commit + push`.
- **Legacy-marker namespace detection** — `compare` / `sync` / `merge`
  refuse to operate on files still carrying the pre-rename
  `my-setup:user-section` marker namespace, with a `sed` command
  prepared inline in the error message.
- **Frozen-tuple CLI registration-order regression test**
  (`tests/test_cli_registration_order.py`) — pins `setforge --help`
  listing order against accidental reorder during a future split or
  rename pass.
- **Per-command-area module docstrings** — each new `setforge/cli/*.py`
  file gets a module-level docstring describing its scope and any
  cross-file dependencies (e.g. the bottom-of-`__init__.py`
  side-effect import block).
- **`setforge --version` flag** — eager Typer callback that prints
  `setforge.__version__` (sourced from `importlib.metadata`) and exits
  before the root callback runs.
- **PyPI publish workflow** at `.github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml` —
  fires on `v*.*.*` tag push, runs `uv build` + `twine check`, uploads
  via `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` using the `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret
  scoped through a `pypi` GitHub environment. `skip-existing: true`
  makes re-pushes of the same tag idempotent.
- **GitHub Release workflow** at `.github/workflows/release.yml` —
  fires on the same tags, creates a GitHub Release with auto-generated
  notes scoped to the commit range between the previous release tag
  and the current one (or full history on the first release).
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** in Keep-a-Changelog 1.1.0 format (this file).
- **`LICENSE` (MIT)** — first formal license file in the repo.
- **PyPI-ready `pyproject.toml` metadata** — `readme`, `license`,
  `authors`, `keywords`, full `classifiers` (intended audience, OS,
  license, topics), and a `[project.urls]` block (homepage, source,
  issues, changelog).

### Fixed
- **`hash=` in semantics position is now a `MarkerError`** instead of
  a silent non-marker fallthrough. The pre-fix
  `_raise_if_malformed_marker` early-returned on `hash=`-prefixed
  first tokens to preserve end-marker hash handling, but the strict
  grammar puts `hash=` in position 3 (after NAME), not position 1; a
  position-1 `hash=` is always malformed. The new error message
  flags the missing-semantics-keyword shape directly.
- **Type tightening across `setforge/`** — removed the project-wide
  ANN001 + ANN401 ruff ignores. The remaining ~27 `typing.Any`
  call sites at the ruamel.yaml + json-five untyped seam (concentrated
  in `setforge/yaml_merge.py` + `setforge/jsonc.py` + 4 sites in
  `setforge/capture_wizard.py`) are now per-file or per-site allowed
  with explanatory comments instead of a project-wide suppression.

### Removed
- **`my-setup` CLI binary** — replaced by `setforge`. `pyproject.toml`
  no longer exposes a `my-setup` entry point.
- **`my_setup.yaml` config-file recognition** — replaced by
  `setforge.yaml`. Loaders surface a migration error pointing at the
  new filename instead of silently accepting the old name.

## [0.1.0]

Earlier development series under the `my-setup` name (no formal release
tag). See the migration section of the README for the upgrade recipe.
